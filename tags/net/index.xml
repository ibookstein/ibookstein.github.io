      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been mildly dissatisfied with my ISP and my home network setup for quite a while now, but it so far hasn&amp;rsquo;t pushed past my threshold to merit addressing. But the situation isn&amp;rsquo;t static. Alternatives have improved, the quality of service has degraded, the cost has increased, and I was planning on overhauling the situation for a coming move anyway.
My current setup is what you would call the ISP&amp;rsquo;s Default Offering.</description>
